Little by little, Epic Games is poking holes in the “just build” mantra held by most Fortnite players. As part of today’s update , for instance, the edge of the storm circle will damage buildings, something that is bound to intensify late-game skirmishes that rely on player-created cover. More broadly, the recent introduction of a grappling hook-like weapon promises to upend everything you know about mobility in Fortnite.
The grappler is a plunger that you can shoot at nearly any surface. When it makes contact, it will propel you toward your target.

Messing around with it a bit this morning, I noticed that it will usually catapult you a little higher than wherever you aim. Coupled with the constant risk of fall damage, learning how to use the grappler is tricky at first.

The grappler makes it hard to feel safe, though: if an enemy has it, they can easily launch themselves behind whatever you’ve built and at top-speeds, too. Footage circulating right now tends to show off quick kills landing on unsuspecting enemies who don’t know how to deal with the incredible mobility that the grappler affords. Behold:
