Nintendo has yet to offer a real discount on the Nintendo Switch, so if you’re looking to snag one, now is as good a time as any short of waiting until the holiday season. Namely, Best Buy’s popular bundle , which includes a 50 percent discount on your choice of one of the system’s best games, is back after selling out in July .
For $329.99, you can pick either the Switch’s grey or neon blue / red color schemes and choose between The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. You’d most likely want to pick up one of those games with a Switch purchase anyway, so this bundle will save you about $30.
Game bundles are still the few options out there if you’re looking for a deal on the Nintendo Switch. With the holiday season approaching, we expect more bundles to drop over these last few months of the year. Just yesterday Nintendo released a Walmart-exclusive Mario Tennis Aces bundle which throws in a copy of 1-2-Switch for free. While the overall cost savings won’t differ too much, it’ll give you the chance to grab your preferred games or accessories at a discount, depending on your gaming style.
